#IP Address Finder

Technologies: React, Redux, Typescript, Sass, Leaflet maps, Axios
API: Abstract API - IP Geolocation

The app displays information about the clients IP or any other IP the user searches for and shows the IP's approximate location on the map.

Information showned:

- Clients IP
- Searched IP
- Location
- Timezone
- ISP

Built mobile first.

Clients IP information is automatically fetched and displayed onload.

For the map, I chose Leaflet / React-Leaflet library with Google Maps tile since it's lightweight, mobile-friendly and very easy to customize.
